This repository refers to the AI4AV Assignment Final Project. As referenced in the Project Report, there have been two models defined - 1) Smartphone data (base case) and 2) Imagery data (stretch case)

The IPYNB files uploaded refert to the two models as follows:
AI4RoadQuality_1 - Base Case
AI4RoadQuality_2 - Stretch Case

The data for the Base Case can be obtained from: Michele Ruta, Floriano Scioscia, Giuseppe Loseto, Agnese Pinto, Eugenio Di Sciascio. Machine learning in the Internet of Things: A semantic-enhanced approach. Semantic Web Journal, Volume 10, Number 1, page 183--204 - 2018. 

The training imagery for the Stretch Case can be obtained from: Bhutad, S., & Patil, K. (2022). Dataset of road surface images with seasons for machine learning applications. Data in brief, 42, 108023. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108023
